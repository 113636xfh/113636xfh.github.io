I am a Master’s student at **Harbin Institute of Technology** (HIT).  My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, planning, and decision-making for autonomous systems.

### Research Interests

- **Multi-Agent Systems**
  - Planar pursuit–evasion game
- **Planning and Decision-Making**
  - Hybrid methods combining classical planning and learning  
  - Interpretable decision-making architectures  
- **Reinforcement Learning with Priors**
  - Imitation learning
  - Residual RL with heuristic or model-based priors  
  - Expert-guided Reinforcement Learning


### Current Research Focus
My current work focuses on bridging classical planning and heuristic methods with modern reinforcement learning, with the goal of improving:

- **Sample efficiency**
- **Interpretability**

### Previous Work

Previously, I worked on topics related to orbital mechanics and space technology, including **satellite maneuver planning** and **satellite performance assessment**.
